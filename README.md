# BinaryTree-FirstCommonAncestor

The following problem is taken from Cracking the coding inteview

First Common Ancestor: Design an algorithm and write code to find the first 
common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes 
in a data structure. NOTE: This is not necessarily a binary search tree.
